# The Hugo-powered antzucaro.com

This is the second iteration of antzucaro.com. This time it is powered by 
[Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com), a static site generator written in 
[Go](http://www.golang.org).

After much deliberation I chose this platform over its peers for its 
simplicity, markdown compatibility, and (of course) speed. As an added bonus, 
Hugo does smart syncing of my static directory. Niiice! It still has a good 
ways to go before it gets some of the conveniences of others like 
[Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com), but right now I'm happy with its balance. 
Great job spf13 and friends!

I mainly update this repository to provide a centralized hub for working on 
posts across my various environments. If you find something useful, great! 
On the other hand you may find some hacks here and there. Be a pal and let me
know if I've screwed something up royally!

Cheers,
-Ant
