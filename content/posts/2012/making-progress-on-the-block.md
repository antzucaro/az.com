Welp, I've made my progress on coding. It was <a href="https://github.com/antzucaro/XonStat/commit/9f4a482f6194a036232e55b6e6917305ab98589c" title="yeah, teeny">trivial</a>, but I hope it will whet my coding appetite! I just did the commit a few minutes back. It felt good, but more importantly it felt natural. That's a start.
