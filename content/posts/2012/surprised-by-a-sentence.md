As time has gone on I think I've grown accustomed to the leaps and bounds by
which Layla grows weekly. Every once in a while, though, she'll really
drop a stunner that leaves me reeling, bringing me back down to earth
with just how much she's progressing. Just last night as I was getting
her ready for bed, she looked up at me and matter-of-factly said "I want
to see the video with the rhino with the horn." We'd been watching some
Youtube videos of rhinos that she'd really enjoyed, and I'd been talking
to her about the horns on top of their nose. For most of the night she'd
say one or two words about the videos, but nothing like the complete
sentence that came out later.

She's just shy of 23 months old today, and I find it totally
jaw-dropping that she'd come up with a sentence of that complexity this
early. I guess it reaffirms my belief that she knows full-well
how to speak in her mind - she's just working on how to get it out! I'll
certainly continue to speak to her in full sentences. From the looks of
things soon enough she'll be responding in kind!
