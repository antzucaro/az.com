Yesterday on my almost daily walks around Reston Town Center I spotted two new sculptures cropping up in the park across from the Rolls Royce building. From the signs nearby they are made out of recycled wood posts.

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-199 " title="RTC sculpture 2" src="/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg" alt="RTC sculpture 2" width="472" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The second new sculpture in RTC.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">It is pretty cool how they are propping the red sculpture up - a clue as  to how it may look when finished? I don't know, but it looks good. Here's a picture taken a little while later (the next afternoon):</p>
