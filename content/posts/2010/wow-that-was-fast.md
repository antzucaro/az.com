I'm not usually a fan of the stupid stuff most websites do on April Fool's Day, but I like what Google is doing with their search results. Note the subtlety:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 561px"><a href="/uploads/2010/04/google_subtle_fun.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-77 " title="google_subtle_fun" src="/uploads/2010/04/google_subtle_fun.jpg" alt="Fast search results" width="561" height="163" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wonky search speeds from Google on April 1st</p></div>

Users are also noting some other fun search speed variations:
<ul>
	<li>nanocenturies</li>
	<li>gigawatts (from Back To The Future)</li>
	<li>parsecs (from Star Wars)</li>
	<li>femtogalactic years</li>
	<li>microfortnights</li>
	<li>centibeats</li>
	<li>centons</li>
	<li>shakes of a lamb's tail</li>
	<li>epochs (time since Jan 1st, 1970 in computer time)</li>
	<li>microweeks</li>
	<li>at <em>NN </em>hertz</li>
	<li>at warp <em>NN</em></li>
</ul>
This beats their most obvious joke hands down, wouldn't you say?
