I'm happy to bring you another player interview! This time I'm talking with one of the core developers of Xonotic, divVerent. We talk about some of the awesome pieces of functionality he's worked on thus far, the importance of attitude and diversity in the community, and of course how he got involved in the game in the first place.

We talked for such a while that it had to be broken up into two parts! In each part the background video is from a small CTF game on Facing Worlds:
