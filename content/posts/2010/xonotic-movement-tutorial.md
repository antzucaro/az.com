<p style="text-align: left;">I recently participated in the making of the Xonotic Movement Tutorial - I provided the voice acting for the English version. In this tutorial video (shown below) both new and old players can learn tips and tricks on moving around in the new version of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Being that the physics have changed considerably, many thought the "depth" to movement disappeared; that the movement in the game was too easy. This is simply not true! There is still much to learn, and this video will get you well on your way:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many thanks to SINSniper (coordination), FruitieX (video editing/demo), chooksta (music), and fabzor (script) for their help in this production.</p>
