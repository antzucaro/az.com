Here is my latest interview with FruitieX from Finland. We talk about his contributions to the project and some of his other interests outside of the game. What's cool about this one is it is the first one using actual Xonotic gameplay from a development (alpha) version of the project as of 11/10. It also features a retextured map (aggressor) that is in the works for the new game as well!
