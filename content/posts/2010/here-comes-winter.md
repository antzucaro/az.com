As I look down at my desktop calendar, I'm completely surprised that it's the end of November <em>already</em>. Time truly does fly when you're having fun, and apparently even more so when you are having fun with an infant!

Kristin doesn't welcome the upcoming winter season, but I certainly do. The different season really gives the days a new feel for me, given that it is dark when I leave for work <em>and</em> when I come home. One benefit of this is getting to see the Reston Town Center skyline as I head out the office door - it makes me feel like I work in Manhatten, as opposed to the 6 square blocks (or so) of RTC:
