Here's another Xonotic player interview for your viewing pleasure! This one is with a regular on the HOCTF scene: Edong23. We talk about his affection for the laser, the servers he operates, and his views on the upcoming Xonotic release. What I really appreciate in this interview (among the others I've done) is his candor. I really like the honesty I'm seeing in this community, because so much depends on transparency! I hope you enjoy.
