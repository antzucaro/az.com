With all of the diet gimmicks in the world, everyone seems to forget that there is another option to lose weight: <em><strong>just eat less</strong></em>. Well, almost everyone - Panera Bread seems to get the concept. They offer apples as a low-calorie alternative to their chips. How low-cal you ask? Take a look for yourself:

Are my eyes just playing a trick on me or is that a <em><strong>really</strong></em> tiny apple? Hmm, let me check - ah, yes! I brought my own apple as a snack today for comparison:
