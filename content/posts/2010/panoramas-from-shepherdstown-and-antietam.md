Here are the panoramas that I mentioned yesterday. They were all assembled from multiple photos of the given location, then stitched together using software (about which I'll have to write a post). Click on the images to see a bigger version.

First up is one of the main buildings of Shepherd University. Situated right near the downtown area of Shepherdstown, it attracted all manner of people and dogs. Very cool!

Next up is the bridge spanning the river with the bridge remnants:

Venturing onto the grounds of Antietam National Battlefield, you can see a pretty good reconstruction of some fences surrounding former farmland:

<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, and as I mentioned before, here we can see Burnside's Bridge. So much action happened here, but it seemed so tranquil in the fading light. I'm happy I grabbed this series of images before it turned dark on me!</p>
