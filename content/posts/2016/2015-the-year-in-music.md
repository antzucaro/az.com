Another year of music is in the bag. 2015 was a good one! Once again we crack
open [summarizr](https://gist.github.com/antzucaro/8212369) to see
what we have...

### Which artists did we listen to the most?

 1. Nine Inch Nails (261)
 2. Frank Turner (246)
 3. Tame Impala (227)
 4. deadmau5 (225)
 5. Awolnation (158)
 6. Coldplay (156)
 7. Metallica (146)
 8. Pink Floyd (142)
 9. Less Than Jake (136)
 10. The War on Drugs (129)

 The stats this year are a bit skewed because I replaced my Revo 3700
 (a full-sized computer) with a
 Raspberry Pi 2 (a credit card sized computer) to save a bit on power. In the process I converted from using
 MPD to Kodi, and I didn't take the time until recently to address Last.FM
 scrobbling with the latter. Oh well, it is still interesting!

 So [NiN](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) comes in at the top spot this year. I think this is mostly me listening
 to "The Fragile" and "Hesitation Marks" at work. I find both of those
 albums familiar enough that they don't distract me while coding, yet still
 block out enough of the ambient office noise to make a difference with respect
 to flow. 

 [Frank Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Turner) is the real newcomer here. I came across his stuff while perusing
 CDs at the Cascades Library. The particular album was "England Keep My Bones,"
 and I fell in love immediately. I went out and purchased his catalog as soon
 as I could, and I haven't regretted a minute of it. He has a fantastic voice
 and moving lyrics. I highly recommend him!

 My other crush of the year was with [Tame Impala](http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala), who released their (yes, I
 know it is
 really one guy) album "Currents" after much anticipation. It was and is
 everything I expected, and has been in constant rotation. My favorites from
 the album are "The Less I Know the Better" and "Reality in Motion". Rock on!

 [AWOLNATION](http://www.last.fm/music/Awolnation) came out with another one during the year as well, which didn't
 disappoint. I expected a good amount of weirdness along with his singing
 magnificence and that's what I got! Favorites from this one are "Hollow Moon"
 and "Woman Woman." 

### How many different artists did we listen to? 

502 (versus 727 last year)

I'm not going to put too much stock into this figure for this year. I didn't
listen to nearly as much SomaFM and I ended my Spotify subscription as
well. This meant I was on my own media-wise. I have a broad and diverse
collection, but it can't compare to those of the larger services out there.
Oddly enough, Spotify spammed me to death towards the end of the year with a
three-for-one deal that I could have taken. If I knew the music-listening
situation at my new job, I might have agreed to it! As it stands I don't know
how musically oriented the office is, and I'd rather not give off a bad
impression as "the new guy with the headphones on all the time." Maybe next
time!

### How many tracks did we listen to per month?

- January: 978
- February: 623
- March: 1052
- April: 1266
- May: 822
- June: 726
- July: 891
- August: 845
- September: 554
- October: 386
- November: 278
- December: 355

Looking at these numbers I can guess that I swapped computers at some point in
September. The scrobbling count dropped dramatically during that time! I didn't
even get my yearly boost from SomaFM's Christmas channel in December. Shame.

### Which artists did we listen to the most by month?

- January: Toy (67)
- February: Nine Inch Nails (46)
- March: Frank Turner (94)
- April: Ramin Djawadi (96)
- May: Thomas Newman (84)
- June: Pink Floyd (32)
- July: Boston (37)
- August: deadmau5 (189)
- September: Metallica (40)
- October: Nine Inch Nails (40)
- November: Nine Inch Nails (45)
- December: Coldplay (51)

[Toy](http://www.last.fm/music/Toy) takes January, when I was definitely on a psychedelic rock kick. I
think I came across them on Tame Impala's "similar artists" page. They take a
little getting used to, but remain a solid choice if you're a rock fan. 

The composer [Ramin Djawadi](http://www.last.fm/music/Ramin+Djawadi) is another notable on this list. He did the
soundtrack for Game of Thrones, and with the show playing during the month we
certainly took advantage of the album. If you're in the mood to feel epic while
you're doing household chores, this is the guy to queue up. 

Another noteworthy artist here is [Boston](http://www.last.fm/music/Boston). After reading a random Reddit comment
about how the group recorded and produced their first album (in short: Tom
Scholz being amazing), I picked it up. I couldn't believe I didn't already have
it, given how amazing it is. Every single song on the album is still in
rotation on the ratio, even today. Crazy.

### What song did we listen to the most?

[The War on Drugs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+War+on+Drugs) - Under the Pressure (16 plays)

It is no surprise that I really like indie and psychedelic rock, so of course
this track makes sense. I love the way this guy blends different sounds
together, and that is immediately apparent in this track. Listen to it and
you'll see!

### How many different artists did we listen to, per month?

- January - 75
- February - 75
- March - 102
- April - 110
- May - 88
- June - 100
- July - 118
- August - 125
- September - 92
- October - 49
- November - 58
- December - 48

I'm pretty happy with my diversity
for the year. I try not to get into any ruts, and it is clear that didn't
happen. Continued visits to the library and various thrift stores should help
to keep these numbers similar in 2016. 

### What album did we listen to the most?

The War on Drugs - Lost in the Dream

Check this guy out. Indie rock at its best!

So there went 2015! All in all a pretty decent year of music. I look forward to
what 2016 brings, although I can't say I've heard much about what to expect.
Maybe a new full-length album from the Foo Fighters or perhaps NiN? I'll be
happily grooving regardless.
