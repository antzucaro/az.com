One benefit to the family moving further north in Sterling is that [Algonkian Regional Park][1] became really accessible. It's a great park with a lot to offer the eyes, and I'm trying to take advantage as much as possible. Not only does the park lead right up to the Potomac River, it also provides ample space to fly kites, picnic, or launch boats, if you're into those types of things. I'm more into the camera-friendly sights, so naturally I gravitate towards the river. What's more is that I can more readily capture sunrise and sunset with a quick side-trip on the way to or from work. What follows is the output from a couple of those side trips.
