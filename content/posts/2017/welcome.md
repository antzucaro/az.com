Every time I go home to Chesapeake I notice the signs of change and
progress. After taking the dog out in the back yard I noticed this cement
placard showing more than a little bit of its age. It's still holding its own,
though. Worn and battered with the weather, but still just as welcoming as the day
it was set.
