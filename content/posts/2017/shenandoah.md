Whenever there's a break in the weather during winter, my first thought is to
pack up and head to Shenandoah. Skyline drive is just *so* inviting and the
kids are getting old enough for some of the smaller hikes. When such an opportunity
presented itself a week back, we set our eyes on Hawksbill Mountain. On paper it
seemed reasonable at only 1.5 miles, but we soon found out that every bit of those
miles was straight uphill. While the kids handled it admirably, they were exhausted
by the end of it.

Everything started out easy-peasy, with everyone getting stoked for the views.
It was a clear day, but it was windy and the chill it brought made us all don
sweatshirts.

We parked at Hawksbill amongst a ton of other cars, then started uphill. Layla
led the pack with a ton of gangly energy, while I followed close by if only to
keep her in view. Kristin and Adie trailed behind, with Adie taking tentative
steps over the rock scrabble.

All the hard work was worth it. Once we turned the corner to the summit we were
greeted with amazing views outward.

Shortly past the Byrd's Nest Shelter #2 on the summit (which isn't much to look at)
is a little stone overlook with a great view of Old Rag Mountain to the east.

Coming down from Hawksbill trail was much easier than going up, and we soon
were enjoying some music and a nice breeze from inside the car. We traveled back
via Luray and stopped at a brand new restaurant for some much-needed lunch.
It turns out that was its opening day, thus we had an inexcusably long wait and
mediocre food. Oh well! Nothing could ruin the great time we had.
