Whenever we're bored, the family and I like to stroll around downtown Leesburg. It's just big enough to be interesting and just small enough to keep the amount of walking reasonable. Nowadays we park in the public lot behind the courthouse and walk out from there, but the garage near the Tally Ho theater is still there for free use on the weekends.

We periodically check the [Shoes Cup and Cork Club](www.shoescupandcork.com) to see if they have completed their remodeling  To our delight on this day, they were back in business! The place is beautiful as ever, and the coffee remains fantastic. Ahhh, that coffee. It's the little things, you know?

Having Adriana in the carrier on my chest raised more than a few glances and comments. One lady commented that I looked so calm and rested despite having an infant. I suppose I hid the fact that I had slept less than 5 hours pretty well then! I told the lady that it wasn't my first rodeo instead of giving away my secret.
