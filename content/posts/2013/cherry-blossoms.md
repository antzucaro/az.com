We're now into the full-on heat of summer. It makes me think back to spring, when the mornings are still crisp and the breezes are enjoyable. Oh, and the cherry blossoms...everywhere! Taken in isolation they are quite beautiful. They just don't seem as beautiful when they are literally carpeting my front porch.
