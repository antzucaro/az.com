This is Layla's work table:

<div class='wp-caption aligncenter'>
  <a href="/uploads/2013/12/Worktable/l/Adriana_014_l.jpg" title="Layla's heavily-used work table">
    <img alt="Layla's heavily-used work table" title="Layla's heavily-used work table" src="/uploads/2013/12/Worktable/m/Adriana_014_m.jpg">
  </a>
    <p class='wp-caption-text'>Layla's heavily-used work table</p>
</div>

At some point I gave up trying to keep it pristine and instead let whatever happen to it... happen. I think I like it better this way because it reminds me of all the fun activities she's done with/on it. I can't think of a better use for a cheapo Ikea table!
