Here's another one from my Outer Banks trip this past summer. Away from
all the commotion of the bigger dunes, I spotted this couple walking
along. I liked how they were framed by the enormous clouds of the day.

I've got a few more pictures from OBX that'll be coming along shortly,
but I thought this was a good "end of a good day" post to have.
