The new year is rapidly approaching, and so is the time when I have to go back to work. Wanting to get the most out of the day, we went out to Shepherdstown, WV to walk around. It had been a really long time since we'd been, and with Layla in daycare all day we wanted to seize the opportunity. We packed up the little one and made the hour and a half journey. 

We started off at the Blue Moon Cafe for lunch. It's a little joint with a lot of character. In typical Shepherdstown fashion, it's rather hippie-ish, with local art and hand-etched Applachian Trail mugs on the walls. The food and service was completely solid, and we left the place bursting at the seams (surprising for a no-meat meal).

We spent the rest of the time taking in the sights of the surrounding old town. For the most part I like the town's look, but in certain places it looks more delapidated than quaint. I suppose I can't complain since it's the decay that draws my eyes - and lens - the most.

The cold was really biting despite the 40-degree temperature. The wind had a mean whip to it, and we were caught unprepared. Kristin borrowed an extra beanie to keep warm. Thankfully I had it in the car...

Just before heading back to the car we spotted the coolest little coffee place. Unfortunately it was closed, but that didn't stop me from peeking through the window. Cool tables, too - the tablecloths were old coffee bean bags. Since the place was closed we grabbed some coffee from Lost Dog instead. It warmed us right up - very rich and flavorful! Maybe next time we'll get some from the roastery.
