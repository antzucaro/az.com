Golden hour is a great time to walk around Leesburg. The sun is setting at just the right angle and all the colors come out to play. We went out for coffee and walked around after, just taking all of it in. I can never get enough.

In particular I love the way the shadows play on the old brickwork that is so prevalent in the area.

I also noticed some new things while waiting for the ladies to check out one of the shops.

The colors are fantastic, as are the little architectural details that you don't see in newer areas, like roof access ladders and car ports.

It is also nice just to imagine what we could do with one of the older properties, and how much personality it would have.

Another trip, another success. Leesburg never lets us down! It is good to know that there's still a ton more to explore out there.
