If you ever feel surrounded by concrete in Fairfax County, VA, do yourself a favor and visit Meadowlark Gardens. There's lots of good foliage to be seen and it is just off the main drag (Lee Highway/Rt.  7). If you have a macro lens or attachment, be sure to bring it - you'll have ample opportunity to record some beauties!
