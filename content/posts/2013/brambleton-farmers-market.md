It always feels good to purchase locally. You get some fresh food and you help out small businesses. This weekend we went to the farmer's market at Brambleton in search of our favorite salsa by [Chef Eloy](http://www.chefeloy.com "The master of salsa"). Seriously, get some if you can! 

On the way out we spotted a fruit stand with the biggest blackberries I have ever seen. The camera at my side had been dormant, but I just had to record these beauties. Behold!
