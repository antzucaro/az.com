Corolla is a good spot to visit if you're in the OBX area. There's plenty of great food and ample things to see. Kristin and I visited on our third day.

You can look out over the sound from some extremely shallow water, where the birds love searching for their dinners.

I suppose someone offers flying tours of the area. That would be pretty amazing! This plane essentially buzzed the tower of the lighthouse:
