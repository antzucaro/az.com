I got these three bottles from Goodwill for a couple of bucks, and I think they are just beautiful. While sticking to the same general shape, I varied up the color and size on just one in order to make it the "centerpiece." I used to have them sitting on top of an antique dresser in my den, but now I have them on top of my bookcase. I love the way they look when they catch the rays of the afternoon sun.
