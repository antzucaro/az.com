Every morning when I come in to work I glance upwards at the sky through the glass canopy at the entrance to my building. Something about the metal and glass structure just draws my eye to it. This is especially true on rainy days when the rain droplets accumulate on the top of the glass, making interesting patterns. It was a mildly rainy day earlier this week and there weren't very many droplets, but their arrangement caught my attention just the same.
