Today we were pleasantly surprised to see the sun peeking out from behind the haze, turning the day beautiful. For the first time in a long while the clouds were out in force and I wanted to take advantage. We went to Middleburg to walk around. 

We hid from the blazingly hot sun by exploring well organized antique shops and fashion stores. We also stopped in a fresh goods store that had a bunch of local produce and meat.

On our way home we decided - on a whim - to stop at a <a href="http://www.swedenburgwines.com/" title="Swedenburg Wines">winery</a> for a glass. The view didn't look great from the entrance, but it really improved once we were near the tasting area. While Layla had a blast running around under the canopy I grabbed a few shots of the vista right in front of us.

Since I've been getting more and more into HDR lately, I wanted to see how the sky turned out when I put it through the process. Not bad!

Kristin and I will certainly keep up with the spontaneous winery trips in the future!
