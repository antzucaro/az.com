There are tons of opportunities for pictures in Golden Gate National Recreation Area and this is one of them. Near Point Bonita lighthouse sits an old military installation that has been abandoned since the early 1900s. Most of the structures are (of course) eroding and covered in graffiti, making them excellent subjects when compared with the gorgeous coastline and views of the bay.
