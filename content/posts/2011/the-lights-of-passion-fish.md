Recently I noticed that the restaurant across the street is lighting up their canopy every day (despite the sunny weather post-Irene). Leaving work I snapped this one quickly as I was walking by. 

<div class='wp-caption aligncenter' style='width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>
<img width='650px' height='431px' alt="Lights under the canopy" title='Lights under the canopy' src='/uploads/2011/08/27RTC/Reston_005_m.jpg'>
<p class='wp-caption-text'>Lights under the canopy <a href='/uploads/2011/08/27RTC/Reston_005_l.jpg'><img alt='See this image in full size' src='/static/fs_img.jpg' /></a></p>
</div>
