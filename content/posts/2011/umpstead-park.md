While visiting a friend in Raleigh he recommended two different sites for me to shoot. The first place was Umpstead Park, located about five minutes away from his house. We woke up early to catch the good light there. A short walk down a hiking path led us to a huge, calm lake. I eyed the walkway and the main entrance area for immersive panos. Here are the results!
