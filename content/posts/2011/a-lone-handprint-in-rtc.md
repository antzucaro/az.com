I often take walks around the entirety of Reston Town Center during my lunch breaks. On one such break I noticed something opposite Reston Town Square Park: a lone handprint on the wooden enclosure surrounding the construction area. I thought it was so unique because there was only one and the art festival from which it came (as a handpainting exhibit was situated right in that same area) happened months earlier. I'm surprised that there weren't more!

 A happy, mischievous child put that there, and that makes me smile.
