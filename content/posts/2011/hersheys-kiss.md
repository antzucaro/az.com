Kristin and I get bags of chocolate to satisfy our *need* for sweets. We find that if we get the bags with little self-contained pieces in it that we won't gorge ourselves as bad as when we have an open bag or batch of cookies. This past week I got some Hershey's Kisses to fill that need. As I reached into the bag I pulled out something unique:

What, is this guy trying to use his wrapping as a rope to get out of the bag? If so, he was unsuccessful. Also delicious.

By the way, a fun fact: the "rope" on the Hershey's Kiss is called the "[nigglywiggly][nw]."
