When I was driving home today the temperature gauge in the car read 101. 101 degrees! That's fricking hot. It ALMOST makes me wish for winter. Looking through my old images I found this one. It's a leaf that got caught upright between the planks of my deck in Bethesda. I want that atmosphere right now, but only on demand; I don't want the dreariness and self-imposed seclusion that often comes along with the cold weather.
