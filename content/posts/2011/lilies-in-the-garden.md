We have some lilies in the garden that we never actually planted. Not that we're complaining! After removing some evil barberry bushes, these guys appeared the next spring as a pleasant surprise. I'm doing my best to keep them alive and healthy. Here's some pictures of them just after I watered the garden this morning.
