I went out yesterday morning to test out my new camera. The light didn't cooperate (it was a hazy, drab morning) so I made one of the shots into an HDR.

This is on Heritage Farm, which is located adjacent to Claude Moore Recreation Center. This was taken really early in the morning, so there were no visitors around. I'll have to revisit this scene if I ever see some epic clouds in the area.
