On the weekends I love to walk around Leesburg. It's about 30 minutes from my home, and it has just the right blend of local shops, antique stores, and walkability to make a great day out. One of the places I enjoy visiting the most is <a href="http://www.momsapplepieco.com/" title="Mom's Apple Pie Company home page">Mom's Apple Pie Company</a>. Situated at the branching of Route 7 and Loudoun streets, I consider it the opening gateway to Old Town Leesburg:

The seemingly large parking lot surrounds what is actually a very small physical location. The storefront itself can't be much more than the size of a large bedroom. 

<div class='wp-caption aligncenter' style='width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>

</div>

As you approach the opening to the storefront you are greeted with an aging door and a welcoming sign. Oh hey - here's where I can find the pie!

Although the company is focused on baked sweets and breads, there are a number of other things available for purchase. When I visited there were some local crafts available.

If you stop by, make sure to look up - they've covered their ceiling with empty pie pans! I don't want to know how long it took them to put those up, but it is certainly a great idea that gives the place a lot of culture.

I visited just last weekend, which was before St. Patrick's Day. They were adequately prepared! I should mention that they do endeavor to get as many ingredients for their food locally. That gets a big thumbs up from me. Not only does that help the local economy, it makes the ingredients that much fresher.

My personal favorite product is the sunflower seed bread. The loaf we purchased that day was just perfect, and it lasted us all week.

As I said before, while the storefront is very small in terms of square footage, Mom's makes up for it with decoration and an overall down-home feel. 

<div class='wp-caption aligncenter' style='width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>

Various local jams and jellies are available for purchase as well. I haven't tried these thus far, so I'll have to grab one next time.

What pie shop would be complete without coffee? I have gotten coffee there before - mmmm.

And now for the namesake of the company: the pies! They are available by the slice...

...or just get the whole thing! My conscious has thus far prevented me from getting one yet (though I have indulged in many a good cookie). I'll have to make my calendar for the next time I'm bringing in breakfast to the office for one of these puppies.

To advertise the current hot product they decorate the outward-facing window.
