For a few months now I've been able to view this nest-like art installation in Reston Town Center. It's pretty neat from the inside. On my daily walks I actually came across the artist and his crew setting it up for the first time. I didn't have a clue at how big the thing would eventually become. Nowadays it is a crowd-pleaser for all the parents who frequent the area. Being in a convenient and relatively contained area, the nest provides a lot of fun for the kids. I just enjoy looking at it from my own roost nearby.
