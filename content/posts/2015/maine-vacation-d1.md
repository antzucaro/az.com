Following quickly on the tail of our Rehoboth weekend, we chose to do our "real" vacation in Maine this summer. As usual it was in early August, but unlike usual we were able to drop the kids off with our parents so we could take a (mostly) worry-free trip. While this is all fine and well, it did mean that we had to travel down to Hampton Roads to drop off the kids at "grandma camp" first. As anyone near a beach area knows, the beach traffic is terrible, and we hit the brunt of it. A three and a half hour trip took us seven full hours, with Kristin steaming at the wheel the whole way.

We arrived at the beach to stay one night with my mother in law before flying up North. While there we went down to the actual beach to enjoy the calm, warm bay water. The kids absolutely loved it for those two qualities! Gone were the pulling undertows and crashing waves of Rehoboth. In their absence the kids could find their confidence in the water again. It was really a joy to see them out there.

   "Beach time for all of my girls!"

I took a stroll down the beach to get myself in the mood for lots of photographs to come. What I captured was a completely different scene from the one I found in Delaware. Being a private beach, there weren't nearly as many people! It was basically the condo residents and their friends.

   "This little pier is in disrepair, but the beach-goers don't mind."

As the sun went down we all went in for a Bob-made dinner. It was fantastic! I will certainly remember the fried eggplant made by a true Italian.

After dinner Layla and I went back down to the beach to get some sunset shots. Everyone had cleared out by this point, and the sky was showing off its color. We took a few shots of the sky and went back in. I had an early flight!
