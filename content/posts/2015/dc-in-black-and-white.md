It has been a couple of years since I've ventured into the city during the peak
cherry blossom blooms. Today we took a day off of work to do so. Being a
Monday, the crowds were not nearly as bad as we'd expected and we could roam
freely about and take all the pictures we wanted. While I have a few panoramas
that I'm still working on, I can share some of the stills from the day. Oddly
enough these shots screamed to be converted to black and white despite all of
the beautiful pink petals everywhere!
