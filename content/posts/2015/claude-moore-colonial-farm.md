Last weekend we went to [Claude Moore Colonial Farm](http://1771.org) in McLean, VA. We'd first stopped at the Bushel and Barrel in Tyson's for an early Father's Day brunch (amazing and recommended), but then we wanted to walk around outside for a bit to take advantage of the beautiful weather. The farm fit the bill, being just a quick side trip away. Kristin had read good things about it and its admission was only $3 for adults and $2 for kids over three.

The farm itself is situated directly across from CIA headquarters in Langley, making for an odd driving experience. On the one side of the road you have all sorts of security fencing and personnel, while on the other you have ramshackle wooden fences and people wearing linen. Once you step past the gate house of the farm and into the park proper, you see nothing but woods and old-style buildings. The place is maintained exactly as it would have been in the year 1771 (hence their web address), with a few employees tending to the land and animals. I found it cool that they will talk and respond to you using the manner of speech used during the time of the farm's operation.

Size-wise the place isn't very big at all, but sight-wise it is quite unique. We appreciated their adherence to authenticity as we walked around the grounds. The kids especially loved the roosters and chickens wandering freely about, plus the giant turkey hanging out nearby. There were true-to-form smelly pigs and a grazing cow as well, completing the experience. All in all it was a great use of about an hour of our time for only $8!
