It's been years since we'd visited Mount Vernon. We took a trip out there on the 20th of April and had a blast. The weather was absolutely perfect and the girls were in great moods. We spent the day walking all throughout the grounds and within the house. We even had a picnic lunch out near the trail! All in all a highly-recommended destination.

I'm always amused by the wear and tear on "lucky" parts of statues like this. Whatever extremity that can be conveniently reached gets worn down and polished by an unknown number of hands. It's like this at the FDR memorial as well as with the bull on Wall Street. I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

I don't know who made these stained glass pieces, but they were impressive. I sat and looked at them for a while. Layla went straight for the tiny model of GW's home instead. I can't blame her.

The estate funnels people in such a way that the first thing you see is this view. It's fitting for a larger-than-life man to have such a front lawn.

Cameras aren't allowed in the interior of the place, so this is the last picture I could take before we entered the house proper. Inside the house was phenomenal, with over 40% of the pieces being originals. This includes a ton of paintings as well as his deathbed.

The view from the back of the house is every bit as impressive as that from the front. It's not just the yard that is beautiful and pristine, either - there's been conservationist efforts over the years to preserve an unmodified view across the Potomac river as well. I do admit that some of the beauty would be gone if you were to see an office building just across the way. :)

All but very few areas were stroller accessible, which was nice. We took our time all throughout, taking in all of the sights.
