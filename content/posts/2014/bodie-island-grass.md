It's a common pattern for me to think about warmer weather in the middle of a cold winter. Lately I've been thinking about the Outer Banks trip we did earlier this year since we recently secured another week there for this year's vacation. 

One of the mornings this year we woke up early to visit the Bodie Island lighthouse. The marsh there was absolutely beautiful. The sun seemed to stream in at just the right angle to highlight the various spider webs and flowers all throughout the area. It really was a sight.
