Several years ago I visited a friend of mine down in Raleigh, NC. On the way there and during I took lots of pictures that I never ended up releasing. I'm sifting them now and finding some of them downright haunting. 

I don't know what led us to this place, but Scott knew about it from his wanderings around the area. It was just an abandoned house in the midst of overgrown weeds, but it captured my attention. We peeked inside for a bit, wondering what moments of life lingered.

After seeing what we came to see, we washed the creepiness away with an obligatory trip to Waffle House.
