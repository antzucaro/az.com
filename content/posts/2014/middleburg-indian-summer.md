Middleburg is another place we like to visit when we've gotten sick of Leesburg. The two are similar in that they each have a good array of restaurants and shops. On a rare warm winter day, we all went out to see what could be seen there.

This is the back parking lot of some storefront. I found it fascinating.

As is our usual custom when visiting anywhere, we had to sample the local coffee. It was as advertised!
